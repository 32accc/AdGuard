    /**
     Executes an operation guarding it with using beginBackgroundTask/endBackgroundTask. Why is this important?
     Note that all heavy operations should be accompanied by calling beginBackgroundTask/endBackgroundTask. There's
     always a chance that the heavy operation does not end when the app is in the foreground (or that they start when
     it is already in the background). In this case there's a high chance that the OS will try to suspend the app.
     The problem is that when the app holds an open file handle, suspending actually transforms into killing an app.
     An open file handle is not necessarily a file, it might mean that you're working with an SQLite database.
     So if we do not use beginBackgroundTask/endBackgroundTask there's a high chance of data corruption.
     The explanation on why it is important can be found in the documentation (see the section on 0xdead10cc).

     - Parameters:
       - name: operation name.
       - checkRemainingTime: if true, we check if the remaining time is enough to run the operation.
       - blockToExecute: the function to execute safely.
     - Returns: true if the operation was successfully executed. false if it was not (not enough remaining time,
        cannot call beginBackgroundTask).
