 * Earlier the engine was created once on the background page
 * for advanced rules conversion (1) into a string
 * and preparation (2) into {@link SelectorsAndScripts} data format â€”
 * the engine is needed for the _preparation_.
 * And content script requested this data by messaging and applied it.
 *
 * The main problem was that the messaging from content script to background page and back
 * took too much time comparing to storage access.
 * So we decided to avoid the messaging when it is possible
 * and create an engine instance in content script.
 *
 * Now the advanced rules are previously converted into a string (1)
 * and set to the storage on the background page,
 * and later in the content script we get the string from the storage,
 * create an engine instance for advanced rule preparation (2), and apply them.
