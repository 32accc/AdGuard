## How to build

### (optional) Install a newer ruby version:

```
brew install ruby
```

Add to your `~/.bash_profile`

```
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/bin:$PATH"
```

### Prepare

Prepare and install Ruby bundler:

- `sudo gem install bundler`

Configure bundler to use local directory for storing dependencies:

- `bundle config set --local path '.bundle/vendor'`

Then run bundle install:

- `bundle install`

**IMPORTANT:** before running Fastlane, you need to place the [App Store Connect API key](https://docs.fastlane.tools/app-store-connect-api/#using-an-app-store-connect-api-key) to `fastlane/AuthKey.p8`.

Then you can run Fastlane using a command like this:

- `bundle exec fastlane [lane]`

Register your device:

- `bundle exec fastlane run register_device udid:"UUID" name:"Device name"`

### Codesigning

Run this command to get proper codesigning certificates:

- `bundle exec fastlane prepare`

### Actions

- `bundle exec fastlane tests` -- run tests
- `bundle exec fastlane build` -- build version for App Store

Actions below are supposed to be used from CI only:

- `bundle exec fastlane adhoc` -- build adhoc version (for inner testing)
- `bundle exec fastlane increment` -- increments build number, commits it to git
- `bundle exec fastlane testflight_beta` -- upload previously built version to testflight

In the case when certificate expires, you may need to nuke the old certs and generate them again:

```
bundle exec fastlane match nuke development
bundle exec fastlane match nuke distribution
bundle exec fastlane generate
```

In order for fastlane to work properly in CI environment, we use [spaceauth](https://docs.fastlane.tools/best-practices/continuous-integration/#use-of-application-specific-passwords-and-spaceauth).

Run this command to generate `FASTLANE_SESSION` which you'll then need to use on the CI server:

```
bundle exec fastlane auth
```
